## Important Information

> Streamer can be installed on any Server, including Windows, but the encoder and Livestream should work fine on any Linux distribution. However we recommend Ubuntu 16 or 17 without any kind of control panel.
> The problem with cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, etc. It's because we need full root access to install some libs, and maybe compile them. Another important point is that to make Livestream work, we need to compile Nginx and the control panels often prevent us from running the commands forcing the installation available only on your panel.




# Why do I need the Encoder?
You may want to install the encoder for a few reasons:
If you have a faster server than the public encoder server (which is likely to happen) or If you'd like a private way of encoding your videos

But the mandatory installation if you are using a private network. The public encoder will not have access to send the videos to your streamer site

If your server does not have a public IP or uses an IP on some of these bands:
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 127.0.0.0/8 (Localhost)
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

Surely you need to install an encoder
